# AP CSP Day 10: input/output scaffold, not a completed binary report.

# conversion, report features, and test comments. Use your existing variable names.
# These sample lists make this template runnable on its own.

# Text and decimal input handling is outside today's task.

# YOUR CODE START
# 1. Add a range decision for whole numbers from 0 through 63.
# 2. Put your existing extraction, bit_text, reconstruction, and report
#    inside the valid branch. Keep the selected label in the report.
# 3. Inside that branch, add an even/odd decision using the remainder.
# 4. In the invalid branch, print only the invalid message after the input echo.
# YOUR CODE END

# OUTPUT PATTERNS: move/uncomment these only in the appropriate branches.
# print(selected_label + ": " + bit_text)
# print("Even")  # or print("Odd")
# print("Outside six-bit range")
